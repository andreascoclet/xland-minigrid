# DoorKeyDeterministic Environment in MiniGrid

## Overview

The DoorKeyDeterministic environment is part of the xminigrid library. It is a deterministic version of the DoorKey environment, where an agent needs to find a key, unlock a door, and exit. The environment allows setting specific positions for the door, wall, and key.

## How to Use
	### 1.	Set Up Environment
Ensure you have the required libraries installed, including jax and xminigrid.
        pip install...
	### 2.	Initialize JAX Key
A random key is used for seeding and splitting.
    import jax
    import xminigrid

    key = jax.random.key(0)
    key, reset_key = jax.random.split(key)
	### 3.	Define Positions
You can specify the positions for the door, wall, and key. The pos should always be a list containing four elements, in the format [door_pos, wall_pos, key_x, key_y]. If not specified, the environment defaults to behavior similar to the original DoorKey environment.
    door_pos = 8
    wall_pos = 8
    key_x = 4
    key_y = 14
    pos = [door_pos, wall_pos, key_x, key_y]  # Always a list
	### 4.	Create the Environment
Use the xminigrid.make function to create the environment and assign the defined positions.
    env, env_params = xminigrid.make("MiniGrid-DoorKeyDet-16x16")
    env.pos = pos
	### 5.	JIT-Compatible Reset and Step Methods
Both reset and step methods are JIT-compatible for efficient computation. The environment can be reset using a JAX-compiled function.
    timestep = jax.jit(env.reset)(env_params, reset_key)
    show_img(env.render(env_params, timestep), dpi=64)

## Default Behavior

If you donâ€™t provide the pos argument, the environment will default to behavior similar to the DoorKey environment, where positions of the door, wall, and key are automatically assigned.
